Deploy and start up
Status Server is distributed in tar.gz or zip archive. Unpack the archive to any location on the local file system. This location is referred as {SS_HOME}. To start Status Server, first define it in the Tango DB (how to define Tango server: https://bitbucket.org/Ingvord/tomography-preexperiment-data-collector/wiki/HowTos#!how-to-set-up-tango-device-server) second â€“ go to {SS_HOME}/bin and launch either StatusServer.sh or StatusServer.bat. Important, before starting it, look through launch script and verify that TANGO_HOST is set properly. This TANGO_HOST defines host where Status Server is defined.
